    %h2 Use Mobile App Markets
    %p
      The next step is to build up your presence on existing mobile app markets. It is not difficult to create Android Developer account and upload your store-front there. But be aware of pitfalls of globalisation, pay special attention to audience of your app. If you are a local vendor - reduce your audience to town or region. This would rank your app above global competition. If you want to reach out to young and beautiful crowd dazzled by Cupertino, then register Apple Developer Account. We would advise to add DroidBrew representative as your team member. This would give us ability to upload your store-front to App Store. Then again, as per Play Market, go local, conjure local community to your side.
