%h1 Learn Androcommerce
%p
  We created Androcommerce with a simple concept in mind: social networking and workplace flexibility. We came up with an idea of how to establish a robust bond between the vendor and the customer. The vendor manages her stores through smartphone or tablet. She communicates with the customer via instant messaging. Any questions are answered in real time. The vendor enjoys unsurpassed workplace flexibility. She is not tied to her desk anymore. We understand only too well the challenges and pressure of modern life - the only thing thatâ€™s constant is change itself. Thus we built Androcommerce as a transparent, interactive and dynamic platform.
