	We may use a technology called "cookies" as part of a normal business procedure. Cookies are small

	text files that are created by a web server and stored on your computer when you visit a website. 

	They don't do anything i.e. they are not executable code and can only be read by (you and) the 

	website that created them. You can view and edit the cookies on your computer like any other text 

	file using a text editor (the contents are usually just strings of unique identifiers and 

	date/timestamps). The website that created the cookie can read the contents when you are at their

	Cookies are widely used across the internet: you may have hundreds of cookies on your computer at 

	any one time. Each browser has its own set of cookies so, if you run multiple browsers, you will have 

	multiple sets of cookies on your computer.

	Many websites use cookies to improve your browsing experience e.g. remember your log-in details, 

	record which items you have selected to purchase, or even tailor what content is displayed 

	depending on your preferences. Cookies can also be used to record 'analytics' data i.e. which web 

	pages you visit, whether or not you arrived at the web page by clicking on an advertisement or an 

	affiliated website. Many websites find the collection of analytics data valuable in improving the 

	quality and content of their web sites.

	In the past, cookies have had some bad press. Much was due to a general misunderstanding of what 

	cookies are and how they work but some was due to justifiable privacy concerns relating to 3rd party 

	tracking cookies. These cookies are used by advertising websites and track a web user across 

	multiple sites. The good news is that all modern browsers allow you to easily block 3rd party cookies.

	All the major browsers allow you to block cookies and delete those that have already been created 

	on your computer, usually within the 'Tools' section of the browser. These tools allow you to specify 

	which cookies you will accept by type and often by specific websites using an exception list e.g. you 

	can block all cookies and then list the website from which you will accept cookies. There are also a 

	wide choice of browser add-ins that you can install if you wish greater control over persistent
