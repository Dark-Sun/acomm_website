%h1 Expanding your clientele base
%p
  Don't worry if you don't have website or online shop. Your very own Androcomerse store-front will be available on Android and iOS which shall let you cover the vast majority of mobile devices. PCs are so last season anyway. You may want to start by giving an interview in local paper, ask them to include web link to your very own Androcomerce Market page where your future customers will be able to see your info and download your store-fronts. You can have as many as you can swing! But why go local? Go full Monty, go global! Say you run a small cycle store in Hackney. Don't be shy; name your app "London Bikes 'n Bikers". These are still very early days for mobile commerce. Be there first, register your app at Android Play Market or Apple App Store. Next time somebody types in the search "buy bike" whilst in London will see your app popping up. This may cause an avalanche of orders.
